## Icons

SVG icons are available in this `brand` directory. They should be copied to the correct location as needed.

All icons are provided as SVGs. They can be converted to other formats as needed.

The `NMPBX_NMPBX_*` are landscape orientation. They feature a stylised version of the product name "NM PBX". `Black_Logo` and `Main_Logo` need to be on a light background. `White_and_Green_Logo` and `White_Logo` need a dark background.

The `NMPBX_X_Isolated_*` are square. They feature just the "X" which is the primary logo. If the image is going to be displayed at small size (anything less than 50px) `NMPBX_X_Isolated_Small.svg` should be used.

## Images

A version of `dots.svg` that is repeated multiple times horizontally should be used in place of the "mountains" graphic used in some places at the bottom of screens in the original Linphone.

## Colours

#25af4b as primary brand colour. If used as a background this should have black text on it.

#0e2826 as secondary brand colour. If used as a background this should have white text on it.

If using a gradient, it should go from #25af4b (the primary brand colour) to #a4cd3a.

## Typeface

Use Poppins for titles and body text.

The truetype font files are available in the `Poppins` sub-directory of this `brand` directory. They should be copied to the correct location as needed.

Bold for main titles.

Medium for sub-titles.

Light for body text.
